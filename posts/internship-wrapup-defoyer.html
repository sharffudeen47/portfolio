            <p>
                My internship with WZC De Foyer was one of the most valuable experiences in my cybersecurity journey because it
                forced me to think beyond “finding vulnerabilities” and focus on what really matters: understanding an
                organization’s environment and helping it improve in a realistic way. Working with internal systems and devices
                showed me that security is often about visibility, consistency, and good decisions — more than flashy exploits.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the biggest lessons I learned is how important scoping and documentation are. In internal testing, it is
                easy to collect a lot of technical output (open ports, banners, service behavior), but the real skill is turning
                that into something meaningful: what does it imply, who is impacted, and what should be fixed first? I improved
                my ability to write findings with clear evidence, explain risk to non-technical stakeholders, and provide
                practical remediation steps that teams can actually implement.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also learned that internal environments contain a mix of modern systems and specialized devices. That changes
                the security approach: you can’t treat everything as a normal laptop or server. Some devices may have limited
                update paths, different ownership, or operational constraints. This taught me to think in terms of risk
                reduction rather than perfect security, and to prioritize controls like segmentation, authentication,
                hardened configuration, and monitoring.
            </p>

            <p>
                Personally, I gained confidence in working independently while staying structured. I developed a repeatable
                workflow for reconnaissance and review, and I strengthened my mindset of being responsible and professional:
                test ethically, document accurately, and communicate clearly. Overall, the internship shaped my professional
                identity as someone who wants to bridge security with infrastructure — understanding how systems run, how risks
                appear in real networks, and how to guide improvements in a way that teams can maintain long-term.
            </p>
