            <p>
                It is easy to get lost in the endless stream of security headlines, zero-day alerts, and CVE notifications. Before attending a recent Tech &amp; Meet session on Threat Intelligence, I viewed "intel" as a sort of advanced news feed. I walked away realizing that real intelligence isn't just about knowing what’s happening it’s about knowing what <strong>matters</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most impactful takeaways from the session was the emphasis on <em>contextual relevance</em>. A dramatic report about a new exploit is just noise if that technology doesn't exist in your environment. I saw this firsthand during my internship: a "critical" vulnerability on paper can be a non-issue in reality if the system is isolated, while a "medium" bug can become a disaster if it sits on a core gateway. The speaker challenged us to always ask: "Does this affect our specific exposure?" This shift from <em>knowing</em> to <em>filtering</em> is what makes security operations sustainable.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was also fascinated by the idea of "intel-driven prioritization." We can’t defend every single inch of a network with the same intensity resources are always limited. Threat intelligence allows a team to move from a reactive "whack-a-mole" approach to a proactive defensive strategy. It tells us which doors the attackers are actually eyeing so we can move our strongest locks there. This structured way of thinking resonates with me deeply; it turns security into a game of strategy rather than a game of luck.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, the session touched on a point that hits close to home for me: the human element of reporting. You can have the most advanced threat data in the world, but if you can’t explain the risk to a system owner in a way that makes sense to them, that data is useless. Security findings need a narrative they need evidence, clear impact, and a realistic path to remediation.
            </p>

            <p>
                For me, threat intelligence is the bridge that connects the chaos of the outside world to the internal reality of a network. It's a skill I want to keep honing, specifically in how we map attacker behavior to our detection rules. Because at the end of the day, the goal isn't just to be "informed" it's to be <strong>effective</strong>.
            </p>
