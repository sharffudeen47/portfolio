            <p>
                I attended a Tech &amp; Meet session titled “.NET 10 Demystified,” which gave me a clearer picture of how modern
                software engineering is evolving and what “good engineering” looks like in real teams. Even though I come from
                a cybersecurity background, I enjoyed how the session connected performance, reliability, and maintainability
                to day-to-day engineering decisions. It reminded me that security is not just a checklist—secure systems are
                usually the ones that are engineered well: consistent practices, clear ownership, and thoughtful architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
                The part I liked most was how the speaker explained the direction of .NET in a practical way, not as marketing.
                The session made me think about how developer tooling, runtime improvements, and cloud-native patterns affect
                security outcomes. For example, when teams standardize logging and use predictable deployment pipelines, it becomes
                easier to detect incidents and respond quickly. When performance improves, teams are less tempted to cut corners
                (like disabling security checks) to “speed things up.” That mindset—building quality into the system instead of
                patching later—matches the security design principles we learn in cybersecurity.
            </p>

            <p>
                My key learning is that modern development platforms are not separate from security; they shape security. Clean
                dependency management, disciplined updates, and secure defaults reduce risk before penetration testing even begins.
                This connects directly to my internship experience: many findings in internal environments are not “advanced hacks”
                but configuration drift, exposed services, or missing controls. Strong engineering practices reduce these issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the session, I followed up on LinkedIn to continue the conversation and explore professional networking
                opportunities (including the idea of a short student podcast). This was useful because it helped me practice
                asking focused questions and approaching experts respectfully. Overall, the session strengthened my motivation
                to stay close to both security and engineering—because the strongest security work happens when you understand how
                systems are actually built and operated.
