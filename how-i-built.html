            <p>
                I built this e-portfolio as a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I host it on GitHub Pages.
                I chose this approach because it matches my professional identity as an IT/Cybersecurity student: I want full
                control over structure, content, and presentation, and I want the site to be easy to maintain throughout my
                final year.
            </p>

            <p>
                GitHub Pages is a strong fit for an e-portfolio because it is reliable, free, and directly connected to the
                workflow used in real IT teams: version control, clean folder structure, and incremental updates. Each change I
                make is tracked in commits, which makes my learning visible and helps me improve the site over time without
                breaking working pages. It also makes it simple to add new blog posts for assignments like Tech &amp; Meet
                reflections—each reflection becomes its own page inside the <strong>/posts</strong> folder.
            </p>

            <p>
                I intentionally avoided building this portfolio as a “personal blog” with random content. The navigation is
                organized around my professional identity: About, Portfolio, Blog/Reflections, and Contact. The Blog section is
                designed for proper 300–500 word reflections, focusing on what I learned and how I will apply it, rather than
                short captions. I also included a separate page for this “How I built it” requirement so the evaluation criteria
                is clearly met.
            </p>

            <p>
                From a technical perspective, I used one shared stylesheet to keep the design consistent across all pages and a
                small JavaScript file to handle navigation behavior and a simple contact form. This keeps the site lightweight,
                fast, and easy to review. If I expand later, I can add more posts, better accessibility, and additional project
                pages—without changing the overall structure.
